# Events reference

Every event the Poolmigo contracts **themselves** define, for indexers, dashboards and integrators.
Standard events inherited from OpenZeppelin are not listed: ERC-20 `Transfer` / `Approval` on the
receipt token, `Upgraded` on UUPS upgrades, and `OwnershipTransferStarted` / `OwnershipTransferred`
(ownership here is always `Ownable2Step`). Sources: `contracts/src/`.

Vector-valued arguments (`tokens[]`, `amounts[]`, `harvested[]`, `fees[]`) are in **registry order** —
the vault's basket order — and parallel to each other.

## Vault — `PoolmigoVaultUpgradeable`

(Declared in `IPoolmigoVault.sol`.)

- **`TokenAdded(address indexed token)`** — one per basket token, as the registry is populated at
  initialization.
- **`Deposited(address indexed sender, address indexed receiver, address[] tokens, uint256[] amounts,
  uint256 shares)`** — an in-kind deposit; `amounts` is what was actually pulled and `shares` what was
  minted (an ordinary deposit or the owner-gated genesis).
- **`Redeemed(address indexed sender, address indexed receiver, uint256 shares, address[] tokens,
  uint256[] amounts)`** — an in-kind redemption; `amounts` is what was paid out.
- **`Deployed(address indexed keeper, address indexed adapter, address[] tokens, uint256[] amounts)`** —
  keeper `deployTo`: capital sent vault → adapter.
- **`PulledFrom(address indexed keeper, address indexed adapter, uint256 sharesBps, address[] tokens,
  uint256[] amounts)`** — keeper `pullFrom`: `amounts` received adapter → vault (`sharesBps` = the
  fraction requested).
- **`Rebalanced(address indexed keeper, address[] tokens, uint256[] harvested, uint256[] fees)`** — one
  per keeper `rebalance`: gross harvested fees/rewards versus the performance-fee slice taken from them.
- **`LiquidityAdded(address indexed keeper, address indexed adapter, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint128
  liquidityAdded, uint256 spent0, uint256 spent1, uint256 refunded0, uint256 refunded1)`** — keeper
  `addLiquidity`: an exact-liquidity add through the adapter; `spent` = what the venue took, `refunded` =
  the unused part of this call's pull (returned to the vault).
- **`LiquidityRemoved(address indexed keeper, address indexed adapter, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint128
  liquidity, uint256 principal0, uint256 principal1, uint256 fees0, uint256 fees1, uint256 idleRefunded0,
  uint256 idleRefunded1)`** — keeper `removeLiquidity`: principal and fees reported apart (fees never
  satisfy a floor and are never principal); with `liquidity = 0` it is the idle-refund mode
  (`idleRefunded` only).
- **`PerformanceFeeAccrued(address indexed treasury, address[] tokens, uint256[] fees)`** — the fee slice
  set aside for the treasury during a rebalance (in kind, never on principal).
- **`SwapSettled(address indexed adapter, address indexed tokenIn, address indexed tokenOut, uint256
  amountIn, uint256 amountOut)`** — keeper `swapExactIn`: vault idle swapped through the adapter's guarded
  venue path (the adapter emits its own `Swapped`, the shared executor `SwapExecuted`); the output settles
  back into the vault.
- **`EmergencyUnwound(address indexed caller, address[] tokens, uint256[] amounts)`** — owner or risk
  manager `emergencyUnwind`: everything pulled back in kind; rebalances are left paused (see
  `PausedSet`).
- **`AdapterAdded(address indexed adapter, bytes32 indexed dex, bytes32 indexed poolId)`** — registry
  add; `dex` / `poolId` are read from the adapter's own report.
- **`AdapterCapabilitySet(address indexed adapter, uint8 capabilities)`** — the adapter's capability mask
  (bit 0 `CAP_LIQUIDITY`, bit 1 `CAP_SWAP`) after a change: derived from the adapter's own ERC-165 answers
  at `addAdapter` (the owner can narrow, never fake, a bit) or owner-toggled via `setAdapterCapability`.
- **`AdapterRemoved(address indexed adapter)`** — graceful removal (position must be empty).
- **`AdapterForceRemoved(address indexed adapter)`** — recovery removal that does not call the adapter;
  whatever assets it still holds stay in it.
- **`KeeperSet(address indexed keeper, bool allowed)`** — keeper whitelist flipped.
- **`RiskManagerSet(address indexed manager, bool allowed)`** — risk-manager whitelist flipped (fast-reaction
  role: one-way `pause()` + `emergencyUnwind()` only — never unpause, never funds).
- **`TreasurySet(address indexed oldTreasury, address indexed newTreasury)`**.
- **`PerformanceFeeSet(uint16 oldBps, uint16 newBps)`**.
- **`PausedSet(bool paused)`** — the vault-wide pause switch (a full safety freeze: deposits,
  redemptions, deploys and rebalances all stop; unpausing is owner-only). Emitted by `setPaused`,
  the one-way `pause()` (owner or a risk manager), and `emergencyUnwind`.
- **`MaxTotalSupplySet(uint256 oldCap, uint256 newCap)`** — supply cap changed; also emitted at
  initialization (with `oldCap = 0`).

## Venue adapters — `UniswapV3Adapter` / `UniswapV4Adapter`

Same name and shape in both unless noted; the v4 differences are called out below the shared list.

- **`RangeSet(int24 ticksBelow, int24 ticksAbove)`** — owner: fresh-range width around the TWAP tick.
- **`TwapWindowSet(uint32 oldWindow, uint32 newWindow)`** — owner: the reference TWAP window.
- **`MaxSlippageSet(uint16 oldBps, uint16 newBps)`** — owner: the deploy-time swap guard.
- **`PositionMinted(uint256 indexed tokenId, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper)`** — one per LP position
  the adapter mints on the venue.
- **`PositionBurned(uint256 indexed tokenId)`** — one per existing position it burns (range redeploy or
  unwind).
- **`Swapped(address indexed tokenIn, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut, uint256 minAmountOut)`** —
  every venue swap — deploy/add-time ratio swaps and the vault-funded `swapExactIn` alike; v4 adds the
  venue: **`…, SwapVenue venue)`**.
- **`LiquidityDeployed(uint256 pulled0, uint256 pulled1, uint256 used0, uint256 used1, uint128
  liquidity)`** — `pulled` = what came from the vault, `used` = what the venue actually took (the
  residue returns to the vault), `liquidity` = units minted.
- **`Withdrawn(address indexed to, uint256 sharesWad, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)`** —
  proportional withdraw back to the vault.
- **`Harvested(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)`** — fees/rewards collected by `harvest`.
- **`Unwound(address indexed to, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)`** — full position exit.
- **`RangeConstraintsSet(int24 minTick, int24 maxTick, int24 minRangeTicks, int24 maxRangeTicks)`** —
  owner: the tick box and width bounds every `addLiquidity` range must satisfy.
- **`LiquidityAdded(uint256 indexed tokenId, uint128 liquidity, uint256 spent0, uint256 spent1, uint256
  refunded0, uint256 refunded1)`** — an exact-liquidity add by the vault (`spent` post-swap, `refunded` =
  this call's leftover sent back to the vault).
- **`LiquidityRemoved(uint256 indexed tokenId, uint128 liquidity, uint256 principal0, uint256 principal1,
  uint256 fees0, uint256 fees1)`** — an exact-liquidity removal by the vault; v4 reports the whole fee bank
  as `fees` (banked fees are never principal).
- **`IdleRefunded(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)`** — idle-refund mode: the free idle sent back to the
  vault (v4 leaves the fee bank in place for `harvest`).

v4-only:

- **`FeesBanked(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)`** — vouchers banked while position liquidity changes;
  banked fees are not principal until settled.
- **`SwapVenueSet(SwapVenue oldVenue, SwapVenue newVenue)`** — owner venue switch
  (`V3_REF_POOL` ↔ `V4_POOL`); also emitted at construction stating the default.

## Swap executor — `UniversalRouterSwapExecutor`

(Declared in `ISwapExecutor.sol`.)

- **`SwapExecuted(address indexed caller, address indexed tokenIn, address indexed tokenOut, uint256
  amountIn, uint256 amountOut)`** — one per exact-input swap executed for the caller (the adapters). The
  executor is permissionless and stateless: it moves only the caller's own tokens and returns the output
  to the caller, so it holds no funds and no approvals between calls.

## Plan executor — `PlanExecutor` (strategy layer)

- **`PlanExecuted(bytes32 indexed planId, address indexed keeper, uint256 nonce)`** — one per successful
  `executePlan`; `planId = keccak256(abi.encode(plan))` (the component list), `nonce` the caller's consumed
  plan nonce (per keeper, strictly sequential).
- **`KeeperSet(address indexed keeper, bool allowed)`** — the executor's **own** caller whitelist (distinct
  from the vault's keeper set of the same name): only these addresses may call `executePlan`, and the
  executor itself must additionally be one of the vault's keepers for the components to land.

## Zap periphery — `PoolmigoZapIn` / `PoolmigoZapOut`

Both:

- **`VaultRegistered(address indexed vault)`** / **`VaultDisabled(address indexed vault)`** — owner
  registry of the vaults the zap may serve.
- **`RouteSet(address indexed tokenIn, address indexed tokenOut, address indexed refPool, uint24
  swapFee, uint16 twapWindow, uint16 maxSlippageBps, uint16 maxDeviationBps)`** — owner route (swap
  venue + guard parameters) set or updated.

`PoolmigoZapIn` only:

- **`ZapDeposited(address indexed caller, address indexed vault, address indexed tokenIn, uint256
  amountIn, uint256 shares, address receiver)`** — a one-token deposit: swapped, deposited, shares to
  `receiver`.
- **`ZapRefunded(address indexed caller, address indexed token, uint256 amount)`** — dust returned to
  the caller (valuation residue of the exact pull).

`PoolmigoZapOut` only:

- **`ZapRedeemed(address indexed caller, address indexed vault, address indexed tokenOut, uint256
  shares, uint256 amountOut, address receiver, uint256[] redeemed)`** — a one-token exit; `redeemed` is
  the in-kind payout the vault reported (reporting only — the sales are sized on the zap's measured
  balance deltas).
- **`ZapSold(address indexed caller, address indexed tokenIn, address indexed tokenOut, uint256
  amountIn, uint256 amountOut)`** — one per swapped leg.
- **`ZapPassThrough(address indexed caller, address indexed token, uint256 amount)`** — that amount is
  delivered in kind, without a swap (no route, or below the dust-sale threshold).

## Upgrade example — `PoolmigoVaultUpgradeExample`

- **`MinRebalanceIntervalSet(uint64 interval)`** — the example upgrade's added parameter; re-emitted on
  change.

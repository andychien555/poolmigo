/**
 * @title PoolmigoVaultUpgradeExample
 * @notice Example next implementation used to prove the upgrade path of the in-kind basket core is
 *         storage-safe. This is an upgrade-path fixture, NOT a released version: it appends ONE field
 *         to a NEW namespaced storage struct (never touches the shipped namespace/layout) and adds a
 *         reinitializer to set it (read back via its namespaced slot). Kept minimal (TEST-ONLY): it
 *         inherits the whole vault and must itself stay under EIP-170 (P3 dropped its setter, event and version
 *         tag; the fix round dropped its getter for the same reason).
 * @dev Storage rule (upgrade skill): the shipped ERC-7201 namespace is untouched; this example uses
 *      its OWN namespace, so there is zero possibility of layout collision. A custom annotation
 *      below records the upgrade source for the OZ plugin validator.

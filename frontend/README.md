# Poolmigo — prototype + live vault

Automated liquidity vaults for less manual LP management on EVM chains. Internal alignment + investor demo build.

Two layers, kept visibly apart:

- **`/live` — the deployed vault.** Real viem wiring against the vault in
  `shared/deployment.local.json`: basket totals, idle vs in-position split, adapters, migoLP balance,
  in-kind deposit and redeem. Every number is a chain read; nothing there is invented.
- **Everything else — the prototype.** The product shell with demo figures (APR, USD, PMG rewards,
  locks, buybacks), all isolated in `src/demo/` and tagged with a **Demo data** badge in the UI.

This package uses **pnpm** (`packageManager` is pinned in `package.json`); npm is not used anywhere.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:5173
pnpm test         # vitest: spec anchors, chain helpers, wallet picker, render smoke test
pnpm build        # tsc + vite build
pnpm sync:shared  # regenerate src/config/generated.ts from ../shared
pnpm e2e:local    # viem end-to-end against the local chain (see below)
```

## Design system

Colour comes in two layers, declared once in `src/lib/tokens.ts`: primitives (the palette) and semantic
tokens (roles). Only the semantic names become Tailwind utilities, so components write `text-strong`,
`bg-fill-weak`, `border-stroke-weak` and cannot reach a raw colour.

- **Gallery:** http://localhost:5173/design-system — tokens and base components, rendered live. It is
  not linked from the header.
- **Reference:** [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md) — token tables and usage rules.

## Running against the local chain

The live page reads the deployed demo stack. From the repo root:

```bash
anvil --chain-id 46630 --port 8547
cd contracts && forge clean && forge build && \
  forge script script/DemoLocal.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8547 --broadcast --private-key $ANVIL_DEV_KEY
cd ../frontend && pnpm sync:shared && pnpm dev
```

Then in your wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet, Brave, Phantom … — see **Wallets** below):

1. **Add network** — pick "Localhost" in the header network selector (or
   press **Switch to …** on the live page) and approve the wallet's add-network prompt. By hand:
   RPC `http://127.0.0.1:8547`, chain id `46630`, currency `ETH`.
2. **Import account** → Anvil account #2 private key
   `0x5de4111afa1a4b94908f83103eb1f1706367c2e68ca870fc3fb9a804cdab365a`
   (address `0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC`) — a publicly known Anvil test key.
   **Local only. Never fund it on a real network.**
3. Open http://localhost:5173/live and connect. Then:
   - **Pick a vault** — the local stack runs two (`demo`: mUSDG / mWETH → `migoLP`; `stocks`: five
     stock tokens + mUSDG → `migoStockLP`). The cards under the header switch everything on the page;
     the choice is remembered per chain (see **Multiple vaults per chain** below).
   - **Mint** — "Local dev tools" (only shown on the local chain) mints the selected vault's basket
     tokens to your wallet (not on the fork demo, whose `demo` basket is real tokens — see below).
   - **Deposit** — enter an amount for *every* basket token (the amounts are maximums; the vault
     pulls only what the binding ratio requires), approve what is short, then deposit. The card
     shows the computed shares, the per-token pull and your `minShares` floor.
   - **Redeem** — enter the vault's receipt token (or Max), check the in-kind breakdown, redeem.

Without a wallet extension the picker offers a **demo wallet** instead: the prototype flows stay
usable, the live vault stays read-only. Without a running chain the live page says so and everything
else keeps working.

If the demo stack is redeployed, re-run `pnpm sync:shared` (addresses are never hand-copied).

**Fork demo:** `contracts/script/fork-demo-up.sh` deploys the same stack on Robinhood Chain state
(real USDG / WETH, real Uniswap v3 + v4 adapters on `demo`; `deployment.local.json` gets `"fork": true,
"mintable": false`) — Local dev tools then hide the mint rows (wallets #0 / #2 are funded at deploy
time) and offer **Fund my wallet**: your wallet is topped up to 1 ETH for gas (`anvil_setBalance`)
and the basket tokens are sent — every token by an anvil-impersonated call from the pool (a real
token transfers, a mock mints; local node only, no wallet prompts either way); `pnpm e2e:local`
asserts those balances instead of minting; runbook in `contracts/README.md`.

**Demo wallets:** every local stack runs on Anvil's standard test accounts — Foundry's public default
mnemonic `test test test test test test test test test test test junk` (**world-known test keys:
local demo only, never on a real network or with real value**). #0 `0xf39F…2266` and #2
`0x3C44…93BC` (= `demoUser`) are funded at deploy time; #1 `0x7099…79C8` is the keeper. Import the
mnemonic in a wallet to act as one of them, or connect any wallet and top up with **Fund my wallet**
— it supplies the basket tokens **and** gas (any wallet is raised to 1 ETH on the local node).

## Wallets

**Connect wallet** opens a picker listing every wallet the browser actually has. There is no
hardcoded list of "supported" wallets and no wallet SDK: discovery is **EIP-6963**
([`mipd`](https://github.com/wevm/mipd)), so any wallet that announces itself shows up with its own
name and icon — MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet, Brave, Phantom, Frame, Zerion, Rainbow, and
anything else installed. A pre-EIP-6963 `window.ethereum` still appears, as **Browser wallet**.

Each choice becomes a viem wallet client (`createClient({ transport: custom(provider) })`). Reads
never need a wallet; only deposit / redeem / mint do, and only on a chain Poolmigo is deployed on,
with a one-click network switch — see **Multi-chain** below.

## Multi-chain

Poolmigo targets any EVM chain, with any number of vaults per chain. The app knows both from one
registry, **`shared/deployments.json`** (schema **v2**):

```jsonc
{
  "version": 2,
  "chains": {
    "4663":  { "name": "Robinhood Chain", "rpcUrl": "https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com",
               "testnet": false, "status": "planned" },
    "8453":  { "name": "Base", "rpcUrl": "https://mainnet.base.org", "testnet": false,
               "status": "deployed", "explorerUrl": "https://basescan.org",
               "vaults": [
                 { "key": "main", "label": "USDC / WETH basket",
                   "receipt": { "name": "migoLP", "symbol": "migoLP" },
                   "vault": "0x…", "implementation": "0x…", "keeper": "0x…" }
               ] }
  }
}
```

- `status: "planned"` — a known chain with no Poolmigo deployment yet. It is offered in the network
  selector; the live page shows "no deployment on this network" there. It may not list vaults.
- `status: "deployed"` — needs a non-empty **`vaults`** list. Each vault entry has exactly:
  - `key` — lowercase slug (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`), unique on that chain; it is what the app remembers
    as "the selected vault", so keep it stable across redeploys;
  - `label` — what the vault picker shows (non-empty);
  - `receipt` — `{ "name", "symbol" }` of the vault's LP token, as passed to `initialize` (non-empty);
    the picker renders it before any chain read, and flags it if the chain's `symbol()` disagrees;
  - `vault`, `implementation`, `keeper` — `0x…40` addresses; optional `demoUser` (address).
  The **first** vault listed is the chain's default. Basket tokens and adapters are NOT listed — the
  app reads them from the vault (`tokens()`, `adapters()`).
- Optional `explorerUrl` — passed to the wallet as `blockExplorerUrls` when it adds the chain.

**Adding a chain** = append an entry (key = decimal chain id) → `pnpm sync:shared` → commit the
regenerated `src/config/generated.ts`. **Adding a vault** to a deployed chain = append one entry
(`key` / `label` / `receipt` / addresses) to its `vaults` → `pnpm sync:shared` → commit. No code
change for either. `sync:shared` validates loudly and names the offending path — e.g.
`deployments.json: chains.8453.vaults[1].key "main" is already used by chains.8453.vaults[0]` (bad
address, missing `vaults` on a deployed chain, duplicate key or vault address, empty label/receipt,
unknown key, non-numeric or duplicate chain id, a JSON key written twice, …). Its output is a pure
function of `shared/` — re-running it on unchanged inputs changes nothing, and a unit test fails if
the committed `generated.ts` drifts from what it would render.

**The local stack keeps flowing from `shared/deployment.local.json`** (`{ "version": 2, "chainId",
"rpcUrl", "vaults": [ … ] }`, written by `DemoLocal.s.sol`; the fork variant `DemoLocalFork.s.sol` adds
the optional `"fork": true, "mintable": false`). `sync:shared` overlays it on the
registry entry with the same chain id: that entry becomes `deployed` + `local`, takes the local file's
RPC, and the local `vaults` **replace** the entry's list. So the `46630` entry carries no vaults of its
own, and a redeploy of the demo stack is still just `pnpm sync:shared`. Local-only conveniences (Local
dev tools / mint) appear only on that `local` chain.

### Multiple vaults per chain

**Which vault the app uses** (`src/chain/vaultSelection.ts`): the vault selected for the target chain,
if its key still exists there; otherwise — nothing selected yet, a key that vanished after a redeploy,
anything unreadable in storage — the chain's **first** vault. The choice is kept **per chain** in
`localStorage` (`poolmigo.vault.selected`, `{ "<chainId>": "<key>" }`), so switching networks and back
returns to the vault you were on. `/live` shows a card per vault (label, receipt symbol, short address,
a live basket hint); with a single vault it collapses to a static strip. Every live read, preview,
balance, position panel, the Local dev tools and the toasts target `(target chain, selected vault)`,
and every React Query key carries the vault address, so switching never shows another vault's data.

**Which chain the app uses** (the *target chain*, `src/chain/targetChain.ts`):

- no wallet → the chain picked in the header selector (default: the local stack, else the first
  deployed chain) — read-only, so the vault renders without any extension;
- wallet on a chain with a deployment → that chain, automatically;
- wallet on a chain without one (a `planned` chain, or anything else) → the selected chain, with a
  "wrong network" banner and a **Switch to …** button; deposit/redeem are blocked until it switches.

**Switching** (`src/chain/switchChain.ts`): `wallet_switchEthereumChain`; if the wallet answers
"unknown chain" (4902, also when nested inside a -32603), `wallet_addEthereumChain` with parameters
built from the registry (`addEthereumChainParams`), then switch again. A rejection is surfaced, never
retried. Every read, receipt wait and write names its chain explicitly — nothing reads a module-level
"the chain" constant.

### WalletConnect (phones and QR)

WalletConnect is **off until you supply a project id** — none is hardcoded, and the option is hidden
(with a short hint) when it is missing.

1. Get a free project id at <https://cloud.reown.com> (create a project → copy the Project ID).
2. `cp .env.example .env.local` and set it:

   ```bash
   VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   ```

3. Restart `pnpm dev`. "WalletConnect" now appears in the picker and opens a QR code.

`.env.local` is gitignored; only `.env.example` is committed. The WalletConnect module is loaded on
demand, so it costs a visitor who connects with a browser extension nothing.

## Demo controls

| Control | How |
|---|---|
| Connect the demo wallet | `?wallet=demo` on any URL, or **Use demo wallet** in the wallet picker |
| Reset demo state | Click the **Poolmigo** wordmark 5 times within 2.5 s |
| Force US market status | `?market=closed` / `?market=open` / `?market=auto` (persists until changed) |
| Open the deposit modal on Explore | `/?deposit=tsla-usdc` |
| Open the claim modal on Explore | `/?claim=1` |
| Force a theme | `?theme=dark` / `?theme=light` (persists; header toggle does the same) |

State is persisted to `localStorage` under `poolmigo-demo-v1`.

## Brand

Dusk direction (the product name is set in `src/lib/brand.ts`). Dark only. Tailwind token *names* were
kept so components did not need to change; the values and a few meanings did (`src/index.css`, `tailwind.config.ts`):

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `deep` | `#150D10` night | page background, wells inside panels |
| `dusk` | `#1F1418` | sheets |
| `panel` / `panel-2` | `#2A1B20` / `#36242A` | cards / hover and selected surfaces |
| `line` / `line-2` | sand at 12% / 24% | borders |
| `ink` / `ink-2` / `ink-3` | `#EFE3D1` / `#C4B19D` / `#9C8878` | text, muted, quiet labels |
| `aqua` | `#EFE3D1` sand | primary actions: there is no second accent colour |
| `up` / `down` / `amber` | `#92D6A6` / `#FF8A8F` / `#E0B07A` | gain / loss / caution |
| `sun` / `sun-core` | `#FFAE3D` / `#FFE3A3` | the price. `apricot` and `tide` (PMG) map to the same colour |
| `glass` | `#B36D5F` rose | decorative |

One rule shapes the interface: **only the price is round**. The sun, the price mark on a range and price points on a
chart are circles; ranges, controls, cards and token tiles are square-cut. The radius scale is small all the way up to
`rounded-full` for that reason; use `rounded-circle` for a real circle.

The motif: two stones mark a range's bounds, the sun marks the price, a graduated scale is the price axis. It appears
as the mark (`components/brand/Mark.tsx`), the range meter on each vault row (`components/vault/RangeMeter.tsx`), the
price range on the vault page (`components/vault/PriceRange.tsx`) and the scene behind the Earn page. That scene is
alive (`components/brand/SkyScene.tsx`): the sun drifts and the stones slide to re-centre on it when it leaves the
gap. It is a three.js scene (`duskScene.ts`) loaded on demand, so three.js stays out of the main bundle; the still
drawing in `Scene.tsx` shows first and remains when WebGL is unavailable. Readings sit on an engraved rule (`StatRow`).

Type: Geist (UI and numerals, tabular; emphasis at 500) and Geist Mono via Google Fonts; Zodiak (page titles, vault
names; light, never bold) from the Fontshare CDN. Zodiak's licence does not allow its font files in a public repository,
so it is loaded by `<link>` in `index.html` and never committed. Every action target is at least 36 px tall (44 px for
primary CTAs).

## Design tokens

Tailwind config is the token source: surfaces `deep` / `dusk` / `panel` / `line`, action `aqua`, semantic `up` / `down` /
`amber`, price and rewards `sun` / `tide`. `font-display` is Geist for numbers and UI titles, `font-serif` (class `title`)
is Zodiak for page-level titles. Chart libraries that cannot read CSS variables take the same colours from `src/lib/theme.ts`.
